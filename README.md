# Description
**Problem Statement:**
Full thickness burn patients need improved vitals assessment and monitoring because of the potential high risks of infection and deficiencies involved in taking their vitals. Burn patients are more susceptible to infection from device contact. Also, their burnt skin makes measurements that necessitate bio-electrodes, such as ECG signals, difficult to acquire. Current methods require placement of vitals monitoring equipment on healthy skin which poses a problem when there is little to no viable skin on the patient.

**Objective:**
Our objective is to create a device that circumvents the current deficiencies in measuring heart rate of severely burned patients without contact. The device must have sufficient durability to be dropped multiple times, be user-friendly for the nurses so a technician is not the only who can operate the device, waterproof, portable enough to be a hand-held device, bleach proof for sanitizing purposes, and simplify the current heart rate measurements in patients with extensive burn wounds that cover most of their bodies. This will minimize the risk of infection and allow nurses to more easily obtain vital signs without direct patient contact.
